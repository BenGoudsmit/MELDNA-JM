# MELDNA-JM

Welcome to the MELDNA-JM help instructions.
Please format your patient data as follows:
- column 1: arbitrary patient ID, e.g. 1
- column 2: meldna
- column 3: time_of_measurement

The MELD-Na scores are measured repeatedly in the same patient.
The time_of_measurement denotes the time in days since first measurement.
For example, at day 0, the patient enters the liver transplantation waiting list.
At day 50, the clinician would like to assess the survival probabilities calculated by the ACLF-JM.
Data is prepared in three columns, the last measurement is the most recent one.
time_of_measurement is thus counted from day 0 (start date of measurement or waiting list entry) until the last available date.
